    "#### Updates from last version\n",
    "- Functionality: Saves metadata for each image as a csv\n",
    "- UI: Uses Chrome Driver to view scraping\n",
    "- Quality of Life: Adds limit to the number of images that the script will download (per prompt)\n",
    "- Includes a demo for reformatting metadata dfs by saving a new CSV file with persistent URLs for each images\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "- The following script is meant to scrapes images from the Umedia website. This way, you have an automated method for downloading historical images of certain buildings\n",
    "- If you want to replicate this script, you'll need to install the required packages and change the 'please have your directory organized like the following. Place this script into the 'scripts' directory and place the 'prompts_test.csv' into the 'data' directory.\n",
