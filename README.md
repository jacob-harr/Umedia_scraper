### GEOG 5900 - Fall 2024
### Author: Jacob Harris
### Date: 2024/12/17

#### Description
- The following script is meant to scrapes images from the [Umedia website](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/). This way, you have an automated method for downloading historical images of certain buildings, people, events, etc.
- If you want to replicate this script, you'll need to install the required packages and maintain the directory strucutre of this repo.
- Chrome Driver allows the user to visualize the webscraping function.
- The metadata collection is meant to be as flexible as possible. I provide the 'process_csv_files' function as a demo by saving the persistent URL for each image to a cleaner CSV file.
